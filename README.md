## Introduction​
Statistics and Data Science Bachelor's Degrees have risen in popularity over the last decade (American Statistics Association, 2022),  but Statistics remains as one of the least popular college majors as of 2024, perceivably due to the difficulty of the subject. ​

The aim of this project was to investigate student engagement data and make suggestions to help CourseKata improve the student experience of learning statistics. By doing so, we wish to find out which variables were the most impactful to student success and make learning of statistics easier for future students.​

This analysis was based on CourseKata's collection of data on student engagement with three online Statistics and Data Science textbooks. To provide more focused feedback, we looked at the book:​

**College / Advanced Statistics and Data Science (ABCD).​**

## Motivation
How much influence does each variable have on the response variable (End-of-Chapter Score) while controlling for the individual differences between students and institutions? ​

## Results
Different types of course materials, such as textbooks or interactive media, influence students' learning methods differently. Thus, it's challenging to suggest improvements to student learning based solely on the current content of textbooks. To better understand how different learning methods affect student success, the next step would be to conduct a Latent Class Analysis. This analysis will help explore the impact of various educational approaches, including interactive media and traditional textbooks.

## Suggestions for CourseKata​
- "Wellbeing Alert" to remind students to take a break when they are engaging with the textbook past midnight​

- Students should maximize their engagement on their first visit to pages to improve their EOC performance​

- Course organizers should ensure the chapters build off of one another ​

- Move the location of the Pulse Questionnaire to after the students take the end of chapter quiz, but before they receive their results​
